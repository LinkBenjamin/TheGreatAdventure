# Welcome to The Great Adventure!  

The greatest adventure is of course... life... the journey each of us is on from the moment we're born.  

In The Great Adventure, we're tapping into that truth to encourage kids to read by creating customized stories where they are the hero.  They provide just a few interesting things about themselves, and we generate a story at their age level where they're the main character.
